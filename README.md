# SIGLNCOS
A computational framework for analyzing single-cell lncRNA regulation
To systematically characterize lncRNAs at single-cell resolution, SIGLNCOS identify cellular-signature lncRNA and release their functional co-regulatory features with the following steps.
Step 1: Constructing lncRNA Visualization landscape. 
Step 2: Identifying cellular-signature lncRNA.
Step 3: Functional enrichment of clncRNAs.
Step 4: Identitying co-lncRNA pairs based on functional co-regulated.
